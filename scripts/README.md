### check-repo-activity.sh

Analyzes **single repository** activity across all branches (main, dev, feature branches).

**When to use:**
- Deep-dive into specific repo
- Finding hidden feature branch work
- Debugging "quiet" repos
- Investigating branch activity

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/check-repo-activity.sh owner/repo [days]

./scripts/check-all.sh > health-report-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

**Runs these checks in order:**
1. Board Health (distribution, missing labels, stale items)
2. Label Consistency (validation, invalid combinations)
3. Quarter/ETA Validation (overdue, velocity)
4. Initiative Completeness (quality score, RASCI)

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Performance
- Use `quick-activity-status.sh` for daily checks (fast)
- Use `live-activity-dashboard.sh` for weekly/monthly reports (thorough)
- Combine scripts for comprehensive analysis
- Save output to files for historical tracking

### Automation
- Schedule weekly via cron: `0 9 * * 1 cd ~/roadmap && ./scripts/check-all.sh > weekly-$(date +%Y%m%d).txt`
- Add to CI/CD for automated quality checks
- Use in pre-commit hooks for initiative validation

### Organization
- Create reports directory: `mkdir -p reports/`
- Save weekly reports: `./scripts/check-all.sh > reports/week-$(date +%Y-W%V).txt`
- Export CSV monthly: `python3 scripts/export-to-csv.py`

### Troubleshooting
- If scripts hang: Check GitHub API rate limits with `gh api rate_limit`
- If auth fails: Re-authenticate with `gh auth login`
- If jq errors: Update jq to latest version
- If date errors: Script auto-detects Linux/macOS date formats
