# Example Initiative 1: Omni - Slack Integration
create_initiative \
    "[Initiative] Omni: Slack Integration" \
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

### What
Add native Slack integration to Automagik Omni for bidirectional messaging between AI agents and Slack channels.

### Why
**Problem:** Many teams use Slack as their primary communication tool. Currently, Omni supports WhatsApp and Discord, but Slack integration is the #1 requested feature from enterprise users.

**Solution:** Implement Slack Bot API integration with MCP tool support.

**Impact:** Enable enterprise teams to deploy AI agents directly in their Slack workspaces.

### Expected Results (RESULTADO_ESPERADO)
- Enable 50+ teams to use Omni in Slack within first month
- Support text messages, file attachments, and threaded conversations
- Maintain <500ms message latency
- Achieve 99.9% message delivery rate

**Responsible:** TBD
**Accountable:** @vasconceloscezar
**Support:** Omni maintainers
**Consulted:** Enterprise users, Slack API experts
**Informed:** Community via Discord

## âœ… Success Criteria

- [ ] Slack bot authentication working
- [ ] Send/receive text messages
- [ ] Support file attachments
- [ ] Thread support for conversations
- [ ] MCP tool registered
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Integration tests passing

# Example Initiative 2: Hive - Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination
create_initiative \
    "[Initiative] Hive: Multi-Agent Swarm Coordination" \
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

### What
Implement swarm intelligence patterns for coordinating multiple AI agents working on complex tasks.

### Why
**Problem:** Current agent orchestration is sequential. Complex tasks requiring parallel execution by multiple specialized agents are inefficient.

**Solution:** Implement swarm coordination patterns (centralized, distributed, hierarchical) with dynamic task allocation.

**Impact:** Reduce complex task completion time by 40%+ through parallel agent execution.

### Expected Results (RESULTADO_ESPERADO)
- Support 3+ coordination patterns (centralized, distributed, hierarchical)
- Enable 5-20 concurrent agents per swarm
- Implement dynamic task allocation algorithm
- Reduce complex task time by 40%

# Example Initiative 3: Cross-Project - Unified Auth System
create_initiative \
    "[Initiative] Cross-Project: Unified Authentication System" \
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

### What
Implement shared authentication and authorization system across all Automagik projects.

### Why
**Problem:** Each project implements auth independently, leading to:
- Inconsistent security practices
- Code duplication
- Difficult user management across projects
- No single sign-on (SSO)

**Solution:** Create shared auth library with JWT tokens, API keys, and OAuth support.

**Impact:** Consistent security, reduced development time, enable SSO across ecosystem.

### Expected Results (RESULTADO_ESPERADO)
- Reduce auth implementation time by 80% for new projects
- Enable SSO across all Automagik projects
- Support JWT, API keys, and OAuth 2.0
- Comprehensive audit logging

# Example Initiative 4: Tools - MCP Tool Marketplace
create_initiative \
    "[Initiative] Tools: MCP Tool Marketplace" \
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

### What
Create a public marketplace for discovering and sharing MCP tools built by the community.

### Why
**Problem:** MCP tools are scattered across repos with no central discovery mechanism. Users don't know what tools exist.

**Solution:** Build a searchable marketplace with categories, ratings, and one-click installation.

**Impact:** Accelerate MCP adoption by making tools discoverable and easy to use.

### Expected Results (RESULTADO_ESPERADO)
- Launch marketplace with 50+ tools
- Enable one-click tool installation
- Implement search and filtering
- Achieve 1000+ tool installs in first quarter

# Example Initiative 5: Spark - Intelligent Scheduling
create_initiative \
    "[Initiative] Spark: Intelligent Scheduling with AI" \
    "## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

### What
Add AI-powered scheduling to Spark that learns optimal execution times based on system load, dependencies, and historical data.

### Why
**Problem:** Current cron-based scheduling is static. Jobs may run during high load or before dependencies are ready.

**Solution:** Implement ML-based scheduler that adapts based on patterns.

**Impact:** Improve job success rate and reduce system load spikes.

### Expected Results (RESULTADO_ESPERADO)
- Increase job success rate by 25%
- Reduce peak system load by 30%
- Automatically learn optimal execution windows
- Support dependency-aware scheduling
