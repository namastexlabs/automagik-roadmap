# üîÑ Stage Definitions

This document defines the lifecycle stages for initiatives in the Automagik roadmap.

---

## Overview

Every initiative progresses through a series of stages from initial exploration to final delivery. These stages help communicate the current state of work and set expectations for stakeholders.

**Stage Flow:**
```
Wishlist ‚Üí Exploring ‚Üí RFC ‚Üí Priorization ‚Üí Executing ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Shipped
                                                                         ‚Üì

- Critical bugs resolved
- Performance acceptable
- Migration path validated
- Documentation ready for GA

**Typical Duration:** 2-8 weeks

**Labels:** `Preview`

**Note:** Not all initiatives require a preview stage. Small features may go straight to shipped.

---

## ‚úÖ Shipped

**Activities:**
- Production deployment
- Announcement and communication
- Monitoring and support
- Gathering usage metrics
- Post-launch iteration

**Exit Criteria:**

- Announcement published
- Monitoring in place
- Expected results being tracked

**Duration:** Ongoing

**Labels:** `Shipped`

**Follow-up:**
- Track expected results
- Monitor for issues
- Plan future enhancements
- Eventually archive when superseded

---

## üì¶ Archived

**Definition:** No longer active or deprioritized.

**Reasons for Archiving:**
- Initiative completed and stable (no further work planned)
- Deprioritized or cancelled
- Superseded by another initiative
- No longer relevant

**Activities:**
- Document final state
- Link to replacement (if applicable)
- Close issue with summary

**Labels:** `Archived`

## Stage Transition Guidelines

### How to Move Between Stages

1. **Update the issue:**
   - Add a comment explaining the transition
   - Update the stage label
   - Update project board fields

2. **Notify stakeholders:**
   - Tag RASCI informed parties
   - Update relevant channels (Discord, etc.)

3. **Update documentation:**
   - Update wish document status (if applicable)
   - Add execution report (if applicable)

### Who Can Change Stages?

- **Responsible:** Proposes stage changes
- **Accountable:** Approves stage changes
- **Community:** Can request clarification or raise concerns

---

## Stage vs. Priority

**Stages** describe *where* an initiative is in its lifecycle.
**Priority** describes *how important* it is relative to other work.

An initiative can be:
- High priority but still in "Exploring" (urgent problem, needs design)
- Low priority but in "Executing" (nice-to-have, already in progress)

Both dimensions are tracked independently.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can initiatives skip stages?**
A: Yes. Small bug fixes or simple features may skip RFC, Preview, etc. Use judgment based on complexity and risk.

**Q: How long should initiatives stay in one stage?**
A: No hard rules. The durations above are guidelines. If an initiative is stuck, discuss in issue comments.

**Q: What if we're unsure which stage to use?**
A: Default to the earlier stage. It's better to be conservative. You can always move forward.

**Q: Can we go backwards?**
A: Yes. If design needs rework or more community feedback is needed, move back to the appropriate stage.
