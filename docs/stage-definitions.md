# üîÑ Stage Definitions

This document defines the lifecycle stages for initiatives in the Automagik roadmap.

---

## Overview

Every initiative progresses through a series of stages from initial exploration to final delivery. These stages help communicate the current state of work and set expectations for stakeholders.

**Stage Flow:**
```
Wishlist ‚Üí Exploring ‚Üí RFC (Decision Gate) ‚Üí Prioritization ‚Üí Executing ‚Üí Preview ‚Üí Shipped
                         ‚Üì                                                              ‚Üì
                    Go/No-Go                                                        Archived
```

## üí° Wishlist

**Definition:** Initial ideation and brainstorming phase. Early concept formation.

**Activities:**
- Initial idea capture
- High-level brainstorming
- Preliminary problem definition
- Opportunity identification

**Exit Criteria:**
- Idea is clearly articulated
- Initial stakeholder interest
- Worth exploring further

**Typical Duration:** 1-2 weeks

**Labels:** `Wishlist`

---

## üîç Exploring

**Definition:** Early investigation and validation phase. We're validating whether this initiative is worth pursuing.

**Activities:**
- Problem research and validation
- User interviews and feedback gathering
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Competitive analysis
- Cost/benefit estimation

**Exit Criteria:**
- Problem is clearly defined
- Proposed solution has broad support
- Technical approach is feasible
- RASCI ownership assigned

**Typical Duration:** 1-4 weeks

**Labels:** `Exploring`

---

## üí¨ RFC (Request for Change / Proposal Stage)

**Definition:** Formal proposal and decision gate. This stage aligns with the GPM "Propose Agent" framework, where structured options are evaluated and a Go/No-Go decision is made before proceeding to implementation planning.

**Activities:**
- Structure findings from Investigation (Exploring) into formal options
- Create formal decision documents:
  - **Product Review**: User impact, market fit, value proposition
  - **Design Review**: Technical architecture, system design, implementation approach
  - **Business Case**: Cost/benefit analysis, resource requirements, ROI
- Facilitate Go/No-Go decision with stakeholders
- Prepare inputs for backlog prioritization (if approved)
- Document decision rationale (whether Go or No-Go)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Proposal formally documented (Product Review, Design Review, Business Case)
- Go/No-Go decision made and recorded
- Stakeholders aligned on decision
- If Go: Backlog inputs prepared for Prioritization stage
- If No-Go: Decision rationale documented, initiative moved to Archived

**Typical Duration:** 2-6 weeks

**Labels:** `RFC`

### Decision Gate

RFC serves as the critical approval gate between Investigation and Prioritization. Unlike the previous "Exploring" stage (which focuses on validating feasibility), RFC focuses on structured decision-making:

- **Exploring** answers: "Can we build this? Should we explore it?"
- **RFC** answers: "Will we build this? Which approach should we take?"
- **Prioritization** answers: "When and how will we build this?"

This gate prevents unvetted initiatives from consuming planning and execution resources.

### Relationship to Other Stages

- **From Exploring**: RFC receives validated findings, technical feasibility, and problem definition
- **To Prioritization**: RFC provides approved proposal, selected approach, and business justification
- **To Archived**: No-Go decisions move directly to Archived with documented rationale

### GPM Propose Agent Alignment

This stage implements the "Propose Agent" pattern from Generative Product Management:
- Converts investigation into actionable proposals
- Structures decision-making with formal review documents
- Enables evidence-based Go/No-Go decisions
- Separates validation (Exploring) from approval (RFC) from planning (Prioritization)

**Note:** For simple initiatives, RFC documentation may be lightweight (combined single document). For complex/high-risk initiatives, all three review documents (Product, Design, Business) should be comprehensive.

## üìã Prioritization

**Definition:** Prioritization and planning phase. Determining implementation approach and timeline.

**Activities:**
- Creating technical specifications
- Designing system architecture
- Planning API contracts
- Designing user flows (if applicable)
- Identifying dependencies
- Writing wish document (if using wish structure)
- Prioritizing features and requirements
- Resource planning

**Exit Criteria:**
- Technical spec completed
- Architecture reviewed and approved
- Dependencies identified and planned
- Success criteria defined
- Wish document created (optional)
- Implementation priority established

**Typical Duration:** 2-8 weeks

**Labels:** `Prioritization`

---

## üî® Executing

**Definition:** Active execution and implementation of the initiative.

**Activities:**
- Writing code
- Implementing features
- Writing tests
- Code reviews
- Documentation updates
- Regular progress updates

**Exit Criteria:**
- Core functionality implemented
- Tests passing
- Code reviewed
- Documentation complete
- Ready for preview/beta release

**Typical Duration:** 4-16 weeks (varies widely)

**Labels:** `Executing`

**Progress Indicators:**
- Update issue with weekly progress
- Link to active PRs
- Update wish document with execution reports

---

## üß™ Preview

**Definition:** Beta or preview release for testing.

**Activities:**
- Beta testing with select users
- Gathering feedback
- Bug fixes and refinements
- Performance testing
- Documentation polishing
- Migration planning (if needed)

**Exit Criteria:**
- Feature is stable
- Critical bugs resolved
- Performance acceptable
- Migration path validated
- Documentation ready for GA

**Typical Duration:** 2-8 weeks

**Labels:** `Preview`

**Note:** Not all initiatives require a preview stage. Small features may go straight to shipped.

---

## ‚úÖ Shipped

**Definition:** Generally available in production.

**Activities:**
- Production deployment
- Announcement and communication
- Monitoring and support
- Gathering usage metrics
- Post-launch iteration

**Exit Criteria:**

- Expected results being tracked

**Duration:** Ongoing

**Labels:** `Shipped`

**Follow-up:**
- Track expected results
- Monitor for issues
- Plan future enhancements
- Eventually archive when superseded

## üì¶ Archived

**Definition:** No longer active or deprioritized.

**Reasons for Archiving:**
- Initiative completed and stable (no further work planned)
- Deprioritized or cancelled
- Superseded by another initiative
- No longer relevant

**Activities:**
- Document final state
- Link to replacement (if applicable)
- Close issue with summary

**Labels:** `Archived`

## Stage Transition Guidelines

### How to Move Between Stages

1. **Update the issue:**
   - Add a comment explaining the transition
   - Update the stage label
   - Update project board fields

2. **Notify stakeholders:**
   - Tag RASCI informed parties
   - Update relevant channels (Discord, etc.)

3. **Update documentation:**
   - Update wish document status (if applicable)
   - Add execution report (if applicable)

### Who Can Change Stages?

- **Responsible:** Proposes stage changes
- **Accountable:** Approves stage changes
- **Community:** Can request clarification or raise concerns

---

## Stage vs. Priority

**Stages** describe *where* an initiative is in its lifecycle.
**Priority** describes *how important* it is relative to other work.

An initiative can be:
- High priority but still in "Exploring" (urgent problem, needs design)
- Low priority but in "Executing" (nice-to-have, already in progress)

Both dimensions are tracked independently.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can initiatives skip stages?**
A: Yes. Small bug fixes or simple features may skip RFC (decision gate), Preview, etc. Use judgment based on complexity and risk. However, skipping RFC means the Accountable owner implicitly approves the initiative without formal review documents.

**Q: How long should initiatives stay in one stage?**
A: No hard rules. The durations above are guidelines. If an initiative is stuck, discuss in issue comments.

**Q: What if we're unsure which stage to use?**
A: Default to the earlier stage. It's better to be conservative. You can always move forward.

**Q: Can we go backwards?**
A: Yes. If design needs rework or more community feedback is needed, move back to the appropriate stage.
