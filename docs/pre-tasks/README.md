## How to Use These Files

### Step 1: Team Review (Before Creating Issues)
Each file contains:
- **Strategic Themes** - Aggregated groups of related tasks
- **Initiative Proposals** - Suggested roadmap initiatives
- **Implementation Tasks** - What goes in project repos
- **Priority & Quarter** - Recommended timeline

**Action:** Review with your team, validate aggregation, adjust priorities

### Step 2: Create Roadmap Initiatives
For each **approved strategic initiative**:
1. Create issue in `automagik-roadmap` using initiative template
2. Populate all fields (project, stage, priority, quarter, RASCI)
3. Link to wish if complex (needs detailed spec)

### Step 3: Create Project Issues (As Needed)
For each **implementation task**:
1. Create issue in project repository (e.g., `automagik-omni`)
2. Link back to roadmap initiative
3. Assign to developers when ready to execute

## The Aggregation Strategy

**Key Principle:** Roadmap = Strategic initiatives, not task list

### What Goes in Roadmap?
‚úÖ **Strategic Initiatives** (2-3 months work)
- Multi-platform messaging expansion
- Agent swarm orchestration
- MCP marketplace platform

### What Goes in Project Repos?
‚úÖ **Implementation Tasks** (days/weeks work)
- Slack API client implementation
- Add webhook handler
- Create MCP tool interface

### Decision Framework
Ask these questions:
1. **Duration:** > 4 weeks? ‚Üí Roadmap
2. **Impact:** Affects 2+ projects? ‚Üí Roadmap
3. **Visibility:** Stakeholders care? ‚Üí Roadmap
4. **Abstraction:** Epic/theme level? ‚Üí Roadmap

## Next Steps

### This Week: Team Review
- [ ] Review each project's strategic aggregation
- [ ] Validate initiative groupings
- [ ] Adjust priorities and quarters
- [ ] Assign preliminary RASCI

### Next Week: Create Initiatives
- [ ] Create Q4 2025 roadmap issues (8-10 initiatives)
- [ ] Create wishes for complex initiatives (3-5 wishes)
- [ ] Populate Q1-Q2 2026 backlog (lighter detail)

### Ongoing: Refinement
- [ ] Move tasks between themes as needed
- [ ] Add new tasks from discussions
- [ ] Remove/merge duplicate initiatives
- [ ] Update as 5w2h docs evolve

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Genie Status
Genie tasks are **preliminary** - based on repo description only.
- **Action Required:** Complete Genie 5w2h documentation
- **Timeline:** Within 2 weeks
- **Then:** Re-aggregate Genie tasks with full context

### üìä Forge Review Needed
Only 4 tasks extracted for Forge despite substantial source content.
- **Action Required:** Validate with Forge lead
- **Question:** Are these truly high-level epics, or did we miss tasks?

### üîó Cross-Project Opportunities
Several initiatives span multiple projects:
- Unified Authentication (all projects)
- MCP Tool Sharing Protocol (Omni, Hive, Genie, Tools)
- Agent Deployment Pipeline (Genie ‚Üí Hive)

See `cross-project.md` for details.
