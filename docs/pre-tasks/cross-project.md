# Cross-Project Strategic Initiatives

**Purpose:** Initiatives that span multiple Automagik projects
**Strategic Value:** Ecosystem cohesion, shared infrastructure, unified experience

---

## Summary

These initiatives affect **2 or more projects** and require cross-team coordination. They represent the "glue" that binds the Automagik ecosystem together.

**Total Cross-Project Initiatives:** 5
**Priority Distribution:**
- CRITICAL: 1
- HIGH: 2
- MEDIUM: 2

---

## Strategic Initiative 1: Unified Authentication & Authorization System

**Affects Projects:** ALL (Omni, Hive, Spark, Forge, Genie, Tools)
**Roadmap Initiative:** Cross-Project: Unified Auth System

### Proposed Roadmap Issue

**Description:**
Single authentication system across the entire Automagik ecosystem. One login, access to all projects. Shared API keys, OAuth tokens, and permission management. Eliminates redundant auth setup and provides unified security model.

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Single sign-on (SSO) across all Automagik projects
- [ ] Centralized API key management
- [ ] Unified OAuth provider integration (GitHub, Google, etc.)
- [ ] Shared permission and role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Cross-project session management
- [ ] Security audit trail across ecosystem
- [ ] 90% reduction in auth setup time for multi-project users

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Quarter:** Q4 2025
**Stage:** Exploring (Issue #3 already exists)
**Type:** infrastructure
**Areas:** auth, security, api
**Wish Needed:** YES - Complex cross-project infrastructure

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Auth Service (Q4 2025)**
- [ ] Centralized auth service/API
- [ ] JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] OAuth provider integration
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] User/org/team data model

**Phase 2: Project Integration (Q1 2026)**
- [ ] Omni auth integration
- [ ] Hive auth integration
- [ ] Spark auth integration
- [ ] Forge auth integration
- [ ] Genie auth integration
- [ ] Tools auth integration

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q1-Q2 2026)**
- [ ] SSO implementation
- [ ] RBAC system
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Security compliance (SOC 2, GDPR)

### Cross-Project Dependencies

- **Omni:** Messaging platform auth (WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
- **Hive:** Agent execution permissions
- **Spark:** Cron job authorization
- **Forge:** GitHub/Git integration auth
- **Genie:** Workspace access control
- **Tools:** Marketplace user accounts

### Notes

**Why this is critical:**
- Currently each project implements own auth (duplication)
- Users must configure auth 6 times
- Security vulnerabilities harder to patch across 6 projects
- Enterprise requires unified access control

**RASCI:**
- Responsible: Auth infrastructure team (to be formed)
- Accountable: CTO/Tech Lead
- Support: All project leads
- Consulted: Security advisor
- Informed: All users, community

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Unified MCP tool discovery API
- [ ] Standard tool packaging format
- [ ] Cross-project tool installation (`omni install <tool>`, `genie install <tool>`)
- [ ] Tool dependency resolution
- [ ] Version compatibility matrix
- [ ] 100% tool portability across projects
- [ ] 3x increase in tool reuse

**Priority:** HIGH
**Quarter:** Q1 2026
**Stage:** Ideation
**Type:** feature, infrastructure
**Areas:** mcp, api, tools
**Wish Needed:** YES - Protocol design needed

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Protocol Design (Q1 2026)**

- [ ] Discovery API design
- [ ] Installation protocol
- [ ] Dependency resolution algorithm
- [ ] Version compatibility rules

**Phase 2: Tools Marketplace Integration**
- [ ] Marketplace API for cross-project discovery
- [ ] Tool metadata schema
- [ ] Search and filter capabilities
- [ ] Rating and compatibility info

**Phase 3: Project Integration**
- [ ] Omni MCP client
- [ ] Hive agent tool loader
- [ ] Genie workspace tool manager
- [ ] CLI commands for all projects

### Cross-Project Benefits

- **Tools:** Central hub for all MCP tools
- **Omni:** Access to 100+ tools without custom code
- **Hive:** Agents can dynamically load tools
- **Genie:** Workspaces bootstrap with curated toolsets

### Notes

**Integration Points:**
- automagik-tools as central registry
- Omni, Hive, Genie as consumers
- Protocol enables ecosystem scaling

- [ ] Automatic workspace → Hive agent conversion
- [ ] Configuration mapping (Genie config → Hive agent spec)
- [ ] Deployment validation and testing
- [ ] Optional Forge review step
- [ ] 10x faster single → swarm scaling
- [ ] Zero manual configuration for deployment

**Priority:** HIGH
**Quarter:** Q1-Q2 2026
**Stage:** Ideation
**Type:** feature
**Areas:** agents, workflows, cli
**Wish Needed:** NO - Clear implementation path

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1: Specification Mapping**
- [ ] Define Genie → Hive schema mapping
- [ ] Agent capability translation
- [ ] Resource requirement mapping
- [ ] Dependency conversion

**Phase 2: Deployment CLI**
- [ ] `genie deploy` command
- [ ] Target environment selection
- [ ] Validation pre-flight checks
- [ ] Deployment execution

**Phase 3: Integration & Testing**
- [ ] Hive agent registration API
- [ ] Deployment rollback capability
- [ ] Health check and monitoring
- [ ] Optional Forge QA step

### Workflow

```
Developer → Genie Workspace (dev/test)
         ↓
    (genie deploy --to-hive)
         ↓
    Optional: Forge Review
         ↓
    Hive Agent Swarm (production)
```

### Notes

**Why this matters:**
- Lowers barrier to multi-agent deployment
- Clear upgrade path from simple to complex
