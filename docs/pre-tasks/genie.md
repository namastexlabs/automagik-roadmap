# Genie - Strategic Task Aggregation

**Total Tasks Extracted:** 22 (preliminary, based on repo description only)
**Strategic Initiatives:** 6 core themes
**Recommended for Q4 2025:** 2 initiatives

**‚ö†Ô∏è Status:** PRELIMINARY - Awaiting complete 5w2h documentation

---

## Summary

Genie tasks were extracted from project description only, as comprehensive 5w2h documentation is pending. These represent the **core vision** of the project but should be validated and expanded once the team completes the brainstorming session.

**Source:**
- Repository: https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-genie
- Description: üßû Automagik Genie ‚Äì bootstrap, update, and roll back AI agent workspaces with a single CLI + MCP toolkit

**Critical Next Step:** Create genie.md, genie-brainstorm.md, genie-meet-transcript.md in repos-5w2h within 2 weeks, then re-aggregate tasks with full context.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Q4 2025
1. **Complete 5w2h documentation ASAP** - Critical gap
2. **Create comprehensive wish** for Core Workspace CLI
3. **Validate technical approach** for state snapshots
4. **Design template format** early

### For Q1 2026
1. **MCP marketplace integration** - ecosystem dependency
2. **Build 10 starter templates** - accelerate adoption
3. **Hive integration design** - plan the export path

### For Q2 2026
1. **Agent framework** - if differentiated from Hive
2. **Plugin system** - community extensibility
3. **DX polish** - reduce friction

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risk: Missing 5w2h Documentation
**Impact:** HIGH
**Mitigation:**
- Schedule brainstorming session within 1 week
- Create genie.md, genie-brainstorm.md, genie-meet-transcript.md
- Re-extract and validate these tasks with full context
- Update roadmap accordingly

### Technical Risks
1. **State snapshot complexity**
   - Mitigation: Use proven tools (git, rsync)

2. **MCP protocol changes**
   - Mitigation: Abstraction layer

3. **Template format evolution**
   - Mitigation: Versioned template schema

### Business Risks
1. **Overlap with Hive**
   - Mitigation: Clear positioning (single vs. multi-agent)

2. **Tools marketplace dependency**
   - Mitigation: Fallback to manual tool installation

---

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PRELIMINARY STATUS
This aggregation is based on **project description only**. The actual strategic direction may differ significantly once the team completes the 5w2h analysis.

**Required Actions:**
1. **Schedule Genie 5w2h session** (within 1 week)
2. **Document in repos-5w2h/** (genie.md, brainstorm, transcript)
3. **Re-aggregate tasks** with full context
4. **Update this file** with validated initiatives
5. **Create roadmap issues** only after validation

### Why This Matters
- Without 5w2h, we're guessing at priorities
- User needs may differ from assumed use cases
- Technical approach may need significant changes
- Business model unclear (open source? SaaS?)

**Do NOT create roadmap issues from this file until 5w2h is complete.**

---

## Next Steps

### This Week
- [ ] Schedule Genie 5w2h brainstorming session
- [ ] Identify Genie project lead and stakeholders
- [ ] Review existing Genie repository for clues
- [ ] Draft 5w2h questions for session

### Next Week (After 5w2h Session)
- [ ] Document session in repos-5w2h/
- [ ] Re-extract tasks with full context
- [ ] Update this strategic aggregation
- [ ] Validate initiatives with team
- [ ] Create roadmap issues for validated initiatives

### Month 1
- [ ] Create wish for Core Workspace CLI
- [ ] Begin Q4 2025 execution
- [ ] Align with cross-project dependencies

---

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PRELIMINARY - Requires 5w2h completion and validation before roadmap creation
