# Forge - Strategic Task Aggregation

**Total Tasks Extracted:** 4 high-level initiatives (from detailed feature analysis)
**Strategic Initiatives:** 3 core themes
**Recommended for Q4 2025:** 2 initiatives

---

## Summary

Forge has a focused strategic direction centered around **AI-powered development orchestration**. Unlike other projects with many tactical tasks, Forge's extraction revealed **3-4 major strategic themes** that each represent substantial platform capabilities.

**Key Insight:** The "4 tasks" are actually **high-level epics** encompassing multiple features each. This is appropriate for Forge's strategic positioning as an orchestration layer.

## Strategic Initiative 1: Multi-Executor AI Orchestration Platform

**Aggregates:** Core platform features, executor management, worktree isolation, comparison system
**Roadmap Initiative:** Forge: Multi-Executor AI Orchestration Platform

### Proposed Roadmap Issue

**Description:**
Transform development workflows by enabling teams to leverage 8+ AI executors (Claude Code, Gemini, Cursor, OpenCode, etc.) through a unified orchestration platform. Execute tasks in isolated git worktrees, compare results across different AI models, and choose the best implementation - all while using your existing AI subscriptions (BYOL - Bring Your Own LLM).

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Support for 8+ AI executors with zero vendor lock-in
- [ ] Git worktree isolation for every task execution (safe parallel execution)
- [ ] Multi-executor comparison: run same task with GPT, Claude, Gemini simultaneously
- [ ] Context engineering system: attach files/folders/screenshots per task
- [ ] 50% improvement in code quality through AI result comparison
- [ ] Zero context bloat through task-level isolation

**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Quarter:** Q4 2025 - Q1 2026
**Stage:** Executing (already in development)
**Type:** feature, infrastructure
**Areas:** agents, workflows, api
**Wish Needed:** YES - Complex architectural initiative

### Implementation Tasks (automagik-forge repo)

**Phase 1: Multi-Executor Foundation**
- [ ] Implement executor abstraction layer
- [ ] Add Claude Code executor integration
- [ ] Add Gemini executor integration
- [ ] Add Cursor CLI executor integration
- [ ] Add OpenCode executor integration
- [ ] Add AWS Bedrock executor integration
- [ ] Implement executor factory pattern
- [ ] Build executor configuration UI

**Phase 2: Worktree Isolation**
- [ ] Implement git worktree creation per task
- [ ] Add worktree cleanup on task completion
- [ ] Build parallel task execution engine
- [ ] Add conflict prevention system
- [ ] Implement worktree status tracking

**Phase 3: Comparison System**
- [ ] Build multi-executor task launcher
- [ ] Implement result comparison UI
- [ ] Add visual diff viewer

- [ ] Add comparison analytics

**Phase 4: Context Engineering**
- [ ] File/folder attachment system
- [ ] Screenshot/diagram upload support
- [ ] Context isolation per task
- [ ] Optimal context size management
- [ ] Visual context preview

### Notes

**Why this is critical:**
- Core differentiator from single-executor tools (Cursor, Copilot)
- BYOL model = no subscription lock-in
- Worktree isolation = safety for experimentation
- Multi-executor = quality through comparison

**Dependencies:**
- Git infrastructure
- UI framework for comparison
- Storage for context artifacts

**Risks:**
- Executor API changes
- Worktree performance at scale
- Context size optimization complexity

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Executor API instability**
   - Mitigation: Abstraction layer, adapter pattern

2. **Worktree performance at scale**
   - Mitigation: Cleanup automation, resource limits

3. **Context size explosion**
   - Mitigation: Smart context pruning, visual preview

### Business Risks
1. **Executor licensing changes**
   - Mitigation: Multi-executor support spreads risk

2. **Competition from single-executor tools**
   - Mitigation: Multi-executor comparison is unique differentiator

### Operational Risks
1. **Support complexity (8+ executors)**
   - Mitigation: Community docs, executor-specific guides

2. **Enterprise deployment complexity**
   - Mitigation: Docker compose, clear deployment guide

---

## Notes on Task Count

**Why only 4 tasks extracted?**

Forge's documentation revealed **4 high-level strategic epics** rather than many tactical tasks. This is actually appropriate because:

1. **Forge is an orchestration layer** - It's about platform capabilities, not feature lists
2. **Each "task" is actually a major theme** - Multi-executor support encompasses 20+ features
3. **Documentation was strategic** - Focused on "what" and "why", not tactical "how"
4. **Still in early stage** - Core platform being defined, not feature backlog

**Recommendation:** Accept these as **3 major strategic initiatives** that will spawn many implementation tasks in the automagik-forge repository.
