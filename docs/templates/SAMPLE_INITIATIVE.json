  "problem_context": "Enterprise teams with 5+ developers currently face severe collaboration bottlenecks. Only one person can edit agent configurations at a time, leading to 'edit queues' where developers wait 15-30 minutes for their turn. When multiple people edit concurrently, the last writer wins, causing lost work and production incidents (3 P1 incidents in Q3 2025 traced to config conflicts). Customer feedback from 3 enterprise pilots indicates this is a blocker for teams >5 people. Competitors (Twilio, Vonage) offer real-time collaboration, putting us at disadvantage for enterprise deals.",
