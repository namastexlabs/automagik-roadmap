## 🗺️ What is the Automagik Roadmap?

This repository is the **single source of truth** for strategic initiatives across the entire Automagik ecosystem. Think of it as:

- 📊 **The Command Center**: Where all projects align on priorities and timelines
- 🎯 **The Context Repository**: Strategic analysis (5w2h) and detailed wishes for each project
- 🤝 **The Community Hub**: Where stakeholders provide feedback and track progress
- 📈 **The Progress Tracker**: From Wishlist → Exploring → RFC → Prioritization → Executing → Preview → Shipped

### 💡 Why a Public Roadmap?

**Transparency** builds trust. **Ownership** drives results. **Structure** enables scale.

**Before:**
- ❌ Roadmap scattered across Slack, Notion, and individual heads
- ❌ Community asks "when will X be ready?" without visibility
- ❌ Cross-project dependencies create surprise blockers
- ❌ No clear ownership = things fall through the cracks

**After (with this repo):**
- ✅ Single place to see what's being built across all projects
- ✅ Clear RASCI ownership (Responsible, Accountable, Support, Consulted, Informed)
- ✅ Expected results tracked for every initiative
- ✅ Community can comment, vote, and contribute ideas
- ✅ Quarterly planning and review cadence

## 🏷️ Labels & Stages

### Development Stages

Our initiatives follow a structured lifecycle inspired by [GitHub's public roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap):

- 💡 **Wishlist** - Initial ideation and brainstorming
- 🔍 **Exploring** - Early investigation, validating the idea
- 💬 **RFC** - Request for comments, gathering community feedback
- 📋 **Prioritization** - Prioritization and planning phase
- 🔨 **Executing** - Active execution and implementation
- 🧪 **Preview** - Beta/preview release for testing
- ✅ **Shipped** - Generally available, live in production
- 📦 **Archived** - No longer active or deprioritized

### Multi-Dimensional Labels

We use a **6-dimensional label system** to organize initiatives:

| Dimension | Examples | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Project** | `project:omni`, `project:hive` | Which project(s) are involved |
| **Stage** | `Exploring`, `Executing` | Current development phase |
| **Type** | `type:feature`, `type:research` | Kind of initiative |
| **Priority** | `priority:critical`, `priority:high` | Urgency level |
| **Quarter** | `quarter:2025-q4`, `quarter:2026-q1` | Target timeframe |
| **Area** | `area:api`, `area:mcp`, `area:agents` | Technical domain |

**Total:** ~40 labels across 6 dimensions for precise organization.
