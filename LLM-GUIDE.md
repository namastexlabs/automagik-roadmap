## What Happens

1. **Script creates GitHub issue** with proper template format
2. **GitHub Actions workflow** (automatic):
   - Adds to project board
   - Sets all 8 custom fields (Project, Stage, Priority, ETA, Status, Owner, Target Date, Expected Results)
   - Applies all labels
   - Posts confirmation comment
