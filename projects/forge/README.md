**Repository:** [namastexlabs/automagik-forge](https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-forge)

## Overview

The maestro of AI-powered development - transforms "vibe coding" chaos into structured productivity. A Kanban board that not only organizes tasks but executes them through any AI agent (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.), with git worktree isolation and multi-agent orchestration. BYOL (Bring Your Own LLM) architecture keeps you in control.
