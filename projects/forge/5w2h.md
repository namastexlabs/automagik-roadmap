# Automagik Forge - 5W2H

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Automagik Forge is the maestro of the AI-assisted development orchestra - a platform that transforms the chaos of "vibe coding" into a productive and controlled symphony. Imagine a superintelligent Kanban that not only organizes your tasks but also executes them through any AI agent you already pay for, keeping you in full control of the process.

It's the natural evolution of AI development: from lost conversations in chats to a structured system where you command, AI executes, and the resulting code is understandable and maintainable.

## 📌 WHAT - What is Automagik Forge?

### Simple Definition

Forge is the "orchestra maestro" of AI-assisted development - it coordinates multiple code agents to execute your tasks in an organized, isolated, and controlled manner.

### Memorable Analogy

> "If AI agents are talented but disorganized musicians, Forge is the maestro that transforms chaos into symphony - each playing their part at the right time, creating harmony where there was once noise."

### Core Capabilities

- ✅ **Kanban Vibe Coding++**: Persistent visual board for AI-executed tasks
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Supports 8+ different agents (Claude, Gemini, Cursor, etc.)
- ✅ **BYOL (Bring Your Own LLM)**: Use the subscription you already pay for
- ✅ **Git Worktree Isolation**: Each attempt in isolated environment
- ✅ **MCP Native**: Remote control via Model Context Protocol
- ✅ **Multiple Attempts**: Compare results from different agents
- ✅ **Visual Context**: Attach screenshots and diagrams to tasks

### Unique Differentiator

> "The only agent-agnostic orchestrator that transforms vibe coding into a structured process" - You maintain full control while experimenting with multiple agents, always choosing the best result.

## 🎬 WHY - Why was it created?

### The Original Problem

> "We started using Claude Code and noticed something scary: the code worked perfectly... for 2 weeks. After that, when something broke, nobody understood what had been done. It was the '2-Week Curse' of vibe coding."

### The Specific Pain

- **Lost Context**: Scattered AI conversations, no structured history
- **Incomprehensible Code**: Generated without developer understanding
- **Duplication and Overengineering**: Multiple attempts generating dead code
- **Impossible to Parallelize**: Difficult to coordinate multiple tasks with AI
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Stuck with a single AI provider

### The Proposed Solution

Create an orchestration framework where:

1. Tasks live in a persistent Kanban
2. Each execution is isolated and traceable
3. You experiment with multiple agents
4. Context is preserved and shared
5. You understand and control what's being done

### The Original Dream

> "We want every developer to become an 'AI-powered developer' - not replaced by AI, but amplified by it. Forge is the toolkit that transforms any dev into a maestro of agents."

## 👥 WHO - For whom and with whom?

### Primary Users

#### 1. The Amplified Developer
- **Who they are**: Developer using Claude Code, Cursor or similar
- **Pain**: Loses control of AI-generated code
- **Gain**: Maintains ownership while accelerating 10x

#### 2. The Orchestrator Tech Lead
- **Who they are**: Technical leader managing team with AI
- **Pain**: Each dev uses AI differently, no standard
- **Gain**: Unified framework for entire team

#### 3. The Pragmatic Experimenter
- **Who they are**: Early adopter testing different AIs
- **Pain**: Stuck with multiple subscriptions without integration
- **Gain**: Uses all subscriptions in one place

#### 4. The Knowledge Worker (Future)
- **Who they are**: Non-dev professional (product, legal, marketing)
- **Pain**: Wants to use AI but has no framework
- **Gain**: Kanban for automating any task

### Integrations in the Ecosystem

## 🔧 HOW - How does it work?

### Simplified Architecture

```
[You] → [Forge Kanban] → [Executor Choice] → [Git Worktree] → [Review] → [Merge]
         ↓                ↓                    ↓
     [Task Card]    [Claude/Gemini/etc]  [Isolated Env]
```

### Main Flow

#### 1. Initial Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
npx automagik-forge
```

- Opens browser with UI
- Connects GitHub (OAuth)
- Selects repository

#### 2. Task Creation

- Drag & drop in Kanban
- Add context (description, files, images)
- Choose executor (Claude, Gemini, etc.)

#### 3. Isolated Execution

- Creates automatic git worktree
- Executor works in isolated environment
- Real-time log streaming

#### 4. Review & Merge

- Visualize side-by-side diffs
- Compare multiple attempts
- Approve and merge to main branch

### Practical Example

```
Task: "Implement JWT authentication"
├── Attempt 1: Claude Code
│   ├── Time: 5 min
│   ├── Result: Complex but secure
│   └── Status: ✅ Approved
│
├── Attempt 2: Gemini
│   ├── Time: 3 min
│   ├── Result: Simple but incomplete
│   └── Status: ❌ Rejected
│
└── Decision: Merge Attempt 1
```

## 🎭 Executive Summary

Automagik Forge was born from a real frustration: AI-generated code that worked perfectly for 2 weeks and then became incomprehensible and unmaintainable. It was the "2-Week Curse" of vibe coding.

Our solution is elegantly simple: a superintelligent Kanban that orchestrates any AI agent you already use (Claude, Gemini, Cursor), executing tasks in isolated environments, allowing multiple attempts and comparisons, keeping you always in control.

Unlike all alternatives, Forge is 100% agnostic - it doesn't matter which LLM you use or which subscription you pay for. It's 100% open source, runs on your machine, no vendor lock-in. It's the only one offering git worktree isolation and multiple attempts comparison.

The result? Developers who become maestros of an orchestra of agents, delivering 10x faster, but with code they understand and can maintain. It's the natural evolution of AI development: from chaotic conversations to structured processes, from mysterious code to understandable solutions.

The future is not humans vs AI, it's humans amplified by AI. And Forge is the platform that makes this a reality.
