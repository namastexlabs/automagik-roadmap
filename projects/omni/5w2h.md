# Automagik Omni - 5W2H

## 🎯 WHAT - What is Automagik Omni?

### Simple Definition

Automagik Omni is a unified messaging hub that functions as an intelligent bridge between AI agents and humans across multiple communication platforms.

### Practical Analogy

Imagine a specialized and intelligent postal carrier that:

- Knows all addresses (messaging platforms)
- Speaks all languages (communication protocols)
- Delivers messages at the right time and in the right format
- Never gets lost or confuses recipients

### Core Capabilities

- **Single Integration**: One integration that connects to all platforms
- **Multi-channel**: WhatsApp, Discord, Slack (soon), Instagram (future)
- **Multi-tenant**: Complete isolation between different instances/clients
- **Unified Intelligence**: Same AI works across any channel
- **MCP Friendly**: Compatible with Model Context Protocol for advanced integration

## 🔍 WHY - Why was it created?

### The Problem

> "Integrating with various instant messaging platforms requires many separate integrations"

Developers face:

- Multiple different APIs to learn
- Maintenance of several separate integrations
- Duplicated code for each platform
- Growing complexity with each new channel
- Common procrastination: "Slack? Ah, I'll do that later..."
- Accumulated frustration and technical barriers

### The Solution

**One integration, all channels.**

Omni solves this by offering:

- Unified interface for all platforms
- Centralized maintenance
- Single deployment for multiple channels
- Consistent behavior across platforms

### The Dream (Why it was created)

**Vision**: Truly Omnipresent Agent - Unified cross-platform experience:

- "I saw something on Instagram, help me with it on WhatsApp"
- Context continuity across all platforms
- Same experience as talking to a person across multiple channels
- The agent knows who you are, regardless of where you talk to it

**Current reality**: WhatsApp and Discord work but don't share context - "it's present, but not omnipresent yet"

## 👥 WHO - For whom and with whom?

### Primary Users

**AI/Chatbot Developers**
- Want to focus on intelligence, not integration
- Need quick deployment across multiple channels

**Multi-channel Customer Service Companies**
- Serve customers on various platforms
- Need consistency in experience

**Specialized Agent Creators**
- Develop agents for specific tasks
- Want to easily distribute across multiple platforms

### Integrations in the Automagik Ecosystem

- **Automagik Hive**: Multi-agent engine and workflows with SSE streaming
- **Automagik UI**: Management interface
- **Automagik Spark**: Advanced orchestration (coming soon)

## 📍 WHERE - Where are we?

### Current State (September 2025)

**✅ WhatsApp (via Evolution API)**
- QR Code login
- Text, media, audio, sticker messages
- Reactions and quoted replies
- Profile management

**✅ Discord (Bot + IPC)**
- Multi-server
- Text and attachments
- Communication via Unix Sockets

**✅ Core Infrastructure**
- Unified REST API
- Complete trace system (stores input, processing, and output)
- Multi-tenancy with isolation
- MCP Server to manage Omni and send messages

**⚠️ Important Limitation:**
- Channels don't share context yet
- Each platform operates independently
- "It's present but not omnipresent"

### Market Position

- **Differentiator**: Only truly multi-tenant and multi-channel solution
- **Focus**: Exceptional Developer Experience
- **Philosophy**: "Configure once, use everywhere"

## ⏰ WHEN - When (Roadmap)?

### Already Delivered (until Sep/2025)

- ✅ Complete WhatsApp via Evolution API
- ✅ Functional Discord with bot + IPC
- ✅ Multi-tenant system with isolation
- ✅ MCP Server for automation
- ✅ Trace and analytics system

### Short Term (Q4 2025) - Immediate Priorities

- 🎯 **Robustness and Scalability** - Resolve Evolution API limitations
- 📅 **Whitelist/Blacklist System** - User access control
- 🔄 **WhatsApp Business with Flows** - Entry into enterprise market
- 🔄 **Slack** - Most requested integration
- 🔧 **Fallback System** - Alternatives to Evolution API

### Medium Term (Q1-Q2 2026) - Expansion and Omnipresence

- 📅 Instagram Direct
- 📅 Telegram
- 📅 Microsoft Teams
- 🌟 **Unified user management** - Finally linking the same person across multiple platforms
- 🌟 **Real omnipresence** - Shared context across all channels
- 📅 Meta Messenger (Facebook)
- 📅 Continuous Developer Experience (DX) improvements

### Long Term (2026-2027) - Complete Vision

- 🎯 LinkedIn Messages
- 🎯 WeChat
- 🎯 TikTok DMs
- 🎯 SMS Gateway
- 🎯 **Complete architecture opening** - Connect with any agent system (OpenAI, etc)
- 🎯 **Open ecosystem** - Allow custom integrations
- 🎯 Support for emerging platforms

## 🔧 HOW - How does it work?

### Simplified Architecture

```
[Human] ←→ [Platform] ←→ [OMNI HUB] ←→ [AI Agent]
           (WhatsApp)      ↙         ↘
           (Discord)   [Traces]    [Config]
           (Slack)    [Analytics]  [Multi-tenant]
```

### Message Flow

1. **Input**: Message arrives from platform (webhook/bot)
2. **Processing**: Omni normalizes and enriches the payload
3. **Routing**: Directs to the correct agent
4. **Response**: Agent processes and returns (supports SSE streaming)
5. **Output**: Omni formats and sends via original platform
6. **Complete Trace**: Stores input, processing, and output for analysis

### How to Use (Happy Path)

```bash
# 1. Start Omni
make dev

# 2. Create an instance
POST /api/v1/instances
{
  "name": "my-assistant",
  "channel_type": "whatsapp",
  "agent_url": "https://my-agent.com"
}

# 3. Connect (WhatsApp = QR Code)
GET /api/v1/instances/my-assistant/qr

# 4. Ready! Messages flow automatically
```

## 💰 HOW MUCH - What's the investment?

### Open Source Model

- **Open source code**: Free to use and modify
- **Self-hosted**: You control your data
- **Community**: Contributions welcome

### Operational Costs

- **Infrastructure**: Configurable according to needs and scale
- **Integrations**: Variable costs depending on chosen platforms
- **AI Models**: Flexible according to provider and model choices

### Expected ROI

- **80%** reduction in integration time
- **5x** simpler maintenance than separate integrations
- **10x** faster time-to-market for new channels
