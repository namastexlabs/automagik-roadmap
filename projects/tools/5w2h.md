# Automagik Tools - 5W2H

> "Creating and hosting MCP is complicated, requires a lot of technical knowledge. We solve this."

## 🎯 WHAT - What is Automagik Tools?

### Simple Definition

Automagik Tools is the "intelligent tools architect" - just as an architect designs and builds buildings, we design and build MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools that allow AIs to communicate with any real-world system.

### 🎨 The Perfect Analogy

Imagine you want your favorite AI (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to be able to:

- Send WhatsApp messages
- Access your emails
- Manage documents
- Control company systems

Today, this is like asking someone to build a bridge without being an engineer. Automagik Tools is the engineering company that builds these bridges in minutes, not months.

### 🚀 Core Capabilities

- 🔧 **Instant Generation**: Transform any API into an MCP tool with 1 command
- 🧠 **Intelligent Tools**: Tools that learn and improve with use
- 📦 **Centralization**: A single place for all organization tools
- 🎯 **Standardization**: All tools follow the same quality standard
- 🚀 **Simple Deploy**: Run anywhere with `uvx automagik-tools`
- 🔄 **Versioning**: Complete control over versions and updates

### ⭐ Our Unique Differentiator

**"From API to AI in 30 seconds"** - While others take weeks creating integrations, we do it before your coffee gets cold.

## 🎯 WHY - Why was it created?

### 🔴 The Real Problem

> "Creating and hosting MCP is complicated, requires a lot of technical knowledge. And even when you create it, each team does it differently, without standardization, without reuse."

### 💔 The Specific Pain

Companies spend months and hundreds of thousands of dollars creating integrations for their AIs:

- Each integration takes 2-4 weeks
- Each developer reinvents the wheel
- No standardization between teams
- Maintenance becomes a nightmare
- Deployment is complex and risky

### 💡 Our Solution

A centralized toolkit that:

- Automatically generates MCPs from any OpenAPI
- Optimizes prompts for each tool
- Centralizes all tools in a single place
- Enables reuse across projects and teams
- Deploy with 1 command

### 🌟 The Original Dream

> "It came from the idea of Smart Tools - tools with specialized Small Language Models that are experts in that specific tool."

We imagine a world where each API has a mini-specialist who knows exactly how to use it in the best way.

## ⚙️ HOW - How does it work?

### 🏗️ Simplified Architecture

```
Your API (OpenAPI) → Automagik Tools → Ready MCP → Your AI
     30 seconds        Auto-optimized    Universal
```

### 🔄 Main Flow

1. **Input**: Your API URL or OpenAPI spec
2. **Processing**:
   - Automatic endpoint analysis
   - Optimized prompt generation
   - Intelligent handler creation
3. **Output**: MCP running, ready to use

### 💻 Practical Example

```bash
# 1. Transform any API into MCP tool
uvx automagik-tools openapi https://api.stripe.com/openapi.json

# 2. Now your AI can process payments!
"Claude, process a payment of $100 for customer John"

# 3. Deploy for entire company
uvx automagik-tools hub --transport sse --port 8000
```

**Result**: In 3 commands, your AI became a complete payment system.

## 📊 Executive Summary

Automagik Tools is the definitive bridge between AIs and the real world. We transform the complex and expensive process of creating MCP integrations into something as simple as running a command. Our platform allows any company, regardless of size or technical expertise, to connect their AIs to any system in minutes, not months.

The problem we solve is critical: companies spend millions creating and maintaining custom integrations, each one different from the other, without standardization or reuse. With Automagik Tools, an integration that would take 3 weeks and cost $9,000 now takes 30 minutes and costs $20.

Our vision is to create an ecosystem where every API in the world has a "mini-specialist" - an intelligent tool that knows exactly how to use that API in the best way. We started with automatic MCP generation, evolved to Smart Tools with SLMs, and are moving towards a future where AIs themselves maintain and improve their tools.

In 2025, we are already the standard choice for companies that want to integrate AIs quickly. With over 5000 installations, 9 native tools in production, and integration with major market players (Claude, OpenAI, Google), we are building the future where every API is a conversation, and every conversation is an action.

## 🎯 Value Proposition

### "From API to AI in 30 seconds"
